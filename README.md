## Hi, I’m Karen 👋
I am a data focused analyst with a background in psychology and a strong foundation in statistical reasoning, predictive modeling, and applied data analysis. I am drawn to problems where the data is messy, incomplete, or fragmented, and where careful analytical thinking is required to produce reliable conclusions rather than surface level results.

My work emphasizes the full analytical process, defining meaningful questions, preparing and validating data, exploring patterns, building and evaluating models, and communicating findings in a way that supports real decision making. I am especially interested in roles that value rigor, clarity, and practical impact over purely theoretical or black box approaches.

I am pursuing opportunities in data analytics and applied data science, with a focus on building models and analyses that are interpretable, defensible, and grounded in strong statistical foundations.

### Education
Master’s in Human Centered Data Science, University of Toronto

Bachelor of Science in Psychology, University of Waterloo \
Minor in Computer Science with training in programming and computational methods

### Data Science Experience
My experience includes both analytical and predictive work across structured and unstructured datasets.
* Conducting exploratory data analysis to understand distributions, relationships, and data quality issues
* Designing analyses and experiments informed by statistical principles
* Cleaning, transforming, and synthesizing large or fragmented datasets
* Building and evaluating predictive models, including regression and random forest
* Using cross validation and appropriate performance metrics to assess model performance
* Interpreting model results, assumptions, and limitations
* Translating analytical findings into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders
